# 6_Python-APIs - WeatherPy and VacationPy

WeatherPy and VacationPy demonstrate the application of Python skills, APIs, and data visualization techniques to analyze and visualize weather data

WeatherPy:
- Visualize weather data for over 500 cities of varying distances from the equator
- Use citipy, OpenWeatherMap API, and codes to create a representative model of weather across cities

VacationPy:
- Use weather data to plan future vacations
- Employ Jupyter notebooks, GeoViews Python library, and Geoapify API to create map visualizations

## Note for Central Grader:
### 1) RE: Feedback Feb 14 at 10:43pm

The "Generate the Cities List by Using the `citipy` Library" part of the code is given by the starter file, but you mentioned that the the expected output for cities is 611 as per Feb 14 at 10:43pm feedback.
However the list is based on random, and Part 1 WeatherPy's instruction only say "over 500 cities". 
I tried re-generating for a few times, and the closest I could get is 610.
Would that be sufficient?

3) For WeatherPy Requirement 2: Compute Linear Regression for Each Relationship, I tried using both manual coding and plotting with the function. 
I am guessing the preferrable way is using the function, however, I won't be able to follow the psuedocodes line-by-line on the starter code file.
The manual coding also seem to be easier to adjust when it comes to the cosmetic look of it - for example: relocating the model's formula.

Therefore, I have decided to display the input and output of both methods.
