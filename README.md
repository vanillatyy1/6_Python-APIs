# 6_Python-APIs - WeatherPy and VacationPy

WeatherPy and VacationPy demonstrate the application of Python skills, APIs, and data visualization techniques to analyze and visualize weather data

WeatherPy:
- Visualize weather data for over 500 cities of varying distances from the equator
- Use citipy, OpenWeatherMap API, and codes to create a representative model of weather across cities

VacationPy:
- Use weather data to plan future vacations
- Employ Jupyter notebooks, GeoViews Python library, and Geoapify API to create map visualizations

## Note for Central Grader:
For WeatherPy Requirement 2: Compute Linear Regression for Each Relationship, I tried using both manual coding and plotting with the function. 
I am guessing the preferrable way is using the function, however, I won't be able to follow the psuedocodes line-by-line on the starter code file.
The manual coding also seem to be easier to adjust when it comes to the cosmetic look of it - for example: relocating the model's formula.

Therefore, I have decided to display the input and output of both methods.
